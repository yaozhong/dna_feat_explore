# DNA nucleotide sequence feature exploration

## Background
In this work, we focused on exploring different representation approaches
for nucleotide sequences of a piece of DNA sequence.
We first sample sequences from exosome coding region and other non-coding
regions. 

###[Assumption]: 
The effectiveness of nucleotide sequence representation is evaluated
with the classification performance of exosome coding region and random non-coding region.

###[Representation]:
* One-hot encoding
* k-mer embedding
