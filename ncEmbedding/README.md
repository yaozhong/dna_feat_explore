## DNA nucleotide sequence feature exploration

### Background
In this work, we focused on exploring different represenation approaches
for nucleotide sequences of a piece of DNA sequence.
We first sample sequences from exosome coding region and other non-coding
regions. 

[Assumption]: We aim to find sequence representations that can distinguish
the coding and noncoding sequences.

[Represeantions]:
* One-hot-coding
* k-mer embedding
